## Overview
Nvidia Deepstream is an incredible accelerated operational inference pipeline? What does that mean?

* Decodes Video
* Runs accelerated Inference
* Re-Encodes

All of this occurs on the GPU as much as possible. One of the bottlenecks in video inference is copying video data back and forth from CPU to GPU memory.
This leads to a massive acceleration.
